## piyush suthar

hello from (prolly) the other side, am piyush. an ecs student and a developer from india. 

as a child, like every other human, i was really fascinated by how computers used to work, and in search of answers i lost the track and came across web development. i've had an okeish time with it though.

finally after a good time with web dev, and app development on the way, i started looking for answer to that old question again and guess what? i found my interest in systems programming, learning to build hardware and a bit of ai/ml.

so i'm currently trying to dive a lot more deep in to realms of systems programming, embedded, etcc.

during the covid lockdown, i had a realisation that i had no personality outside tech, so started teaching myself a lot of different stuff, ended up loving playing flute (indian bansuri) the most.

i play it almost everyday now and have also performed on stage (ikik, pretty big deal for me).

### education
i've wasted a good amount of my time trying to prepare for jee (couldn't clear), maths was fun though.

so currently pursuing BE in electronics and computer science (hopefully 2027) in a local college.

### books

i used to be someone who rarely appreciated the knowledge in books, always praised the internet.

guess what? books are a goldmine of knowledge. this happened especially after i took interest in hardware and electronics. it's so convinient to just read books.

i don't have any book to write about here as of now, but i'll be reading and possibly implement "the art of electronics".

i've read a few novels, mostly from scifi genre.

a few of them include
- dune
- harry potter series
- the count of monte cristo
- project hail mary
- a thousand splendid suns

and a few more

currently reading 
- the karamazov brother's (wanted to read dostoyevsky's work)
- three body problem
